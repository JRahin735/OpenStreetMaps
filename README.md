# OpenStreetMaps

- Implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm to create an application to find the shortest paths between many nodes.
- Applied maps as a data structure in C++ to create complex paths from OSM’s raw data files.

This project was completed as a part of CS 251 @UIC Spring'23 under Prof. Adam Kohler
